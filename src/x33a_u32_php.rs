/// Implements 32 bit version of one of the original hash functions post by Daniel J. Bernstein but
/// with final OR to set the high bit.
///
/// PHP uses a zero hash value to signal an empty hash that will need to be calculated. To insure no
/// actual hash ends up being zero a final step of binary OR is used to always set the high bit.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::hash::Hasher;
/// use djb_hash::HasherU32;
/// use djb_hash::x33a_u32_php::*;
/// let input = "Ez";
/// let mut hasher = X33aU32Php::new();
/// hasher.write(&input.as_bytes());
/// assert_eq!(hasher.finish(), 2153345956u64);
/// assert_eq!(hasher.finish_u32(), 2153345956u32);
/// ```

    /// Creates a new hash using user supplied salt value.
    ///
    /// The supplied salt needs to be a prime number. It should have bits in
    /// more than just the lower 8 bits but setting any bits past half the size
    /// of the hash is of limited use as they are quickly lost during the
    /// multiplication stage for long values and tend to because static for very
    /// short values. Primes between 16 to 32 bits for 64 bit hashes seem to
    /// work best in most cases and between 16 to 24 bits for 32 bit hashes.
