use std::hash::Hasher;

///
/// Implements 64 bit version of one of the original hash functions post by Daniel J. Bernstein.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::hash::Hasher;
/// use djb_hash::x33a::*;
/// let input = "Ez";
/// let mut hasher = X33a::new();
/// hasher.write(&input.as_bytes());
/// assert_eq!(hasher.finish(), 5862308u64);
/// ```
/// Another example:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use std::hash::Hasher;
/// # use djb_hash::x33a::*;
/// let input = "FY";
/// let mut hasher = X33a::new();
/// hasher.write(&input.as_bytes());
/// assert_eq!(hasher.finish(), 5862308u64);
/// ```
///
/// These two examples show one of the known issues with this hash function:
/// hash collision. Both strings hash to the same value. If it was being used in
/// a public face HashMap it would open a possible DoS attack vector. Java, JS,
/// Python and PHP have all experience these types of attacks when using this or
/// other similar hash functions.
///
/// Adding prefixes and/or suffixes will change the hash but not the collision.
/// An example:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use std::hash::Hasher;
/// # use djb_hash::x33a::*;
/// let input1 = "abcEzpie";
/// let input2 = "abcFYpie";
/// let mut hasher1 = X33a::new();
/// let mut hasher2 = X33a::new();
/// hasher1.write(&input1.as_bytes());
/// hasher2.write(&input2.as_bytes());
/// assert_eq!(hasher1.finish(), 7572149288326856u64);
/// assert_eq!(hasher1.finish(), hasher2.finish());
/// ```
///
pub struct X33a {
    hash: u64,
}

impl X33a {
    ///
    /// Creates a new hash using the original 5381 prime number salt value used by DJB.
    ///
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        X33a { hash: 5381 }
    }
    ///
    /// Creates a new hash using user supplied salt value.
    ///
    /// The supplied salt needs to be a prime number. It should have bits in
    /// more than just the lower 8 bits but setting any bits past half the size
    /// of the hash is of limited use as they are quickly lost during the
    /// multiplication stage for long values and tend to because static for very
    /// short values. Primes between 16 to 32 bits for 64 bit hashes seem to
    /// work best in most cases and between 16 to 24 bits for 32 bit hashes.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use std::hash::Hasher;
    /// use djb_hash::x33a::*;
    /// let input = "Ez";
    /// let mut hasher = X33a::new_with_salt(5381);
    /// hasher.write(&input.as_bytes());
    /// assert_eq!(hasher.finish(), 5862308u64);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Another example:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// # use std::hash::Hasher;
    /// # use djb_hash::x33a::*;
    /// let input = "FY";
    /// let mut hasher = X33a::new_with_salt(5387);
    /// hasher.write(&input.as_bytes());
    /// assert_eq!(hasher.finish(), 5868842u64);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// These examples show how the hashes change with different salts but in
    /// the next example you can see the same strings, "Ez" and "FY", will still
    /// collide.
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// # use std::hash::Hasher;
