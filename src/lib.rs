//! This library is a collection of simple and fast hash functions based on
//! designs done by Daniel J. Bernstein. Since these hash functions are very
//! simple they have several known limitations and should be use with
//! ___extreme caution___ if used for things like key hashes in HashMap, etc.
//! Most of them are venerable to key collisions which can lead to DOS attacks
//! if exposed in any way to external bad actors.
//!
//! After all that being said, many other languages, like Java, JS, Python,
//! and PHP, have use versions of them internally and it was felt that there
//! would be some utility for Rust to have the hash functions available when
//! doing interoperable code in these cases.
//!
//! ## Understanding hash names
//!
//! The hash names are based on the mathematical functions they use to create
//! hashes. I'll start with breaking down one here: "X33a". The "X##" is the
//! multiplier stage, so before appending the next byte of data to be hashed the
//! existing hash value will be multiplied by the number given which in this
//! case is 33. This number will always be prime and to make the calculation as
//! fast as possible only primes that are binary multiples + or - one are used.
//! The reason is that actual multiplication is slow but bit shifting which act
//! like multiplying in binary and addition or subtraction are much faster.
//! For 33 it is convert to a shift of 5 (times 32) and then add the original
//! number to equal the final 33.
//!
//! Next there is the "a" part. The "a" stand for "add". After multiplying the
//! running hash total as given above the next byte to be hashed is added to it
//! to form the new hash total. Some hashes instead of adding use XOR
//! (Exclusive OR) and would have an "x" where the "a" is in example I've been
//! using. Using XOR usually does a better job of distributing the effect of the
//! new byte across more of the hash bits but the effect is less noticeable when
//! using single byte on a longer hash like is done here.
//!
//! Finally there are the one or more "Xxx" suffixes. The suffix "U32" means
//! that internally a 32 bit unsigned integer hash total is used instead of the
//! normal 64 bit one. Often even on 64 bit platforms 32 bit operations can be
//! faster and may be better fit for an application. Rust by default always
//! returns 64 bit hashes from its finish() function but since often only a
//! 32 bit hash is needed I have added 32 bit version s as well. To return a 64
//! bit hash the internal 32 bit one will be zero extended to 64 bits in
//! finish(). To save from converting to 64 bits then back to 32 bits when only
//! 32 bits are needed the finish_u32() function can be used instead of the
//! normal finish() function with all of the 32 bit hash versions.
//!
//! The last "Xxx" part of the suffix denotes some additional operation or
//! other specialization like is done in some application. A good example of
//! this is in PHP where the high bit is always set because they use a zero hash
//! value to detect an unset hash.
//!
